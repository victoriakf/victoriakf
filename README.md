### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Victoria from Norway! I'm currently starting my second year studying front-end design. 
I am especially interested in making user-friendly solutions that also look aesthetically pleasing. 

I still have a lot to learn, and besides trying to come up with modern and nice-looking designs I find it especially interesting to work on javascript and UX-design.
